# travel-planner

A travel planner app that allows you to generate an itinerary tailored to your preferences.

You can start off by creating an account, which will save in the database. Using those details you can also sign back in, if you have logged out. Once at the homepage, you can view the already existing trips you have generated, or generate a new itinerary.

To create a new itinerary select "add a new trip. Then by selecting your destination, amount of days for your visit and preferences, an itinerary will be generated based on your selections. The amount of days you specified will be generated. With each day consisting of 3 activites and 3 restaurants. 

By selecting a generated day, you can view the details of the activites and restaurants, and see their locations on the map. You can click on the markers on the map, which will zoom into the location and show extra information. You can then click on the center button underneath the map, to center your map back to its original state. 

Scrolling further down, you can view the same activities and restaurants but presented in a clearer and more dynamic way. By selecting "return to your itinerary" at the very bottom, it allows you to go back to the previous page containing the rest of your days generated. Clicking on "return to your trips" will take you to the trips page, where you can view or delete any of the trips you have generated. 

In the top left corner of the app, there is a hamburger menu that allows for shortcuts to the homepage and trips page. You can also use the hamburger menu to logout.
