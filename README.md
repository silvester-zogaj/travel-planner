# travel-planner

A travel planner app that allows us to register an account, have it saved in the database. And then using those details you can sign back in. Once at the homepage, you can view you already existing trips you have generated, or generate a new itinerary. By selecting your destination, amount of days for your visit, and preferences, an itinerary will be generated based on your selections. The amount of days you specified will be generated. With each day consisting of 3 activites and 3 restaurants. By selecting a day, you can view the details of the activites and restaurants, and view them on the map. You can click on the markers for the map to focus, zoom into the location and show extra information. You can then click on center, to center your map back to its original state. Scrolling further down, you can view the same activities and restaurants but presented in a clearer and more dynamic way. By selecting return to your itinerary at the very bottom, it allows you to go back to the previous page containing the rest of your days generated. Clicking on "return to your trips" will take you to the trips page, where you can view or delete all the trips you have generated. In the top left corner of the app, there is a hamburger menu that allows for shortcuts to the homepage and trips page. You can also use the hamburger menu to logout.
